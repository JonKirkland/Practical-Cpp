STACKS:
	A stack is an algorithm for storing data
	Data can be added / removed using the push and pop operations
	Data is stored in a Last in First out order
	Can think of it as adding / removing pieces of paper to a stack of papers

	Designing a Stack:
		Fortunately other people have designed stacks, C++ comes with a stack class as part of the Standard Template Library.
		We start a stack design by designing the data structure. This structure will need a place to put the data, and a count
		of the number of items currently pushed on the stack

		eg:
			const int STACK_SIZE = 100;
			//the stack:
			struct stack{
				int count;
				int data[STACK_SIZE];
			};

		Next, the routinmes to handle the push and pop operations need to be created.
		The push function stores the item on the stack and then increases the data count.
